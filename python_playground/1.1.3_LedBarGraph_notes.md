# Some thoughts

See this documentation: https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/PWM/ .

```python
# To import, set mode and set the pin for output
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO; GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM); pin=21; GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT)

# Set the pin to high
GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.HIGH)
# Set the pin to low
GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW)

# Set a pin to PWM and start at DutyCycle 0
p=None; p=GPIO.PWM(pin, 50); p.start(0)

# Start a pin in PWM, 50 cycles per second
#	Means that there will be 50 cycle every second
GPIO.PWM(pin, 50);

# Change the duty cycle to 100
#	Means in every cycle the light will be on 100% of the time
p.ChangeDutyCycle(100)

# Change the duty cycle to 50
# 	Means in every cycle the light will be on 50% of the time
#	If there is 1 cycle every second that means the light will be on 0.5 seconds and off 0.5 seconds
#	If there is 10 cycle every second
#		each cycle takes 0.1 seconds
#		that means the light will be on 0.05 seconds and off 0.05 seconds
#	If there is 0.1 cycles every second
#		each cycle takes 10 seconds
#		that means the light will be on 5 seconds and off 5 seconds
p.ChangeDutyCycle(50)

# Example from https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/PWM/
while 1:
	for dc in range(0, 101, 5):
		p.ChangeDutyCycle(dc)
		time.sleep(0.1)
	for dc in range(100, -1, -5):
		p.ChangeDutyCycle(dc)
		time.sleep(0.1)
```
